# 🌍 World Population Data Scraping & Visualization (Python)

This project uses **Python web scraping** to collect global population data from a public source and transform it into meaningful visual insights. The analysis helps illustrate how population is distributed across countries and highlights patterns that would otherwise be difficult to see in raw data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Using Python and web scraping (BeautifulSoup), I extracted population data for all countries, cleaned and processed the dataset, and then visualized the results using different chart types to highlight trends, extremes, and comparisons across nations.

Below are the visual results from the analysis:

### 🔹 Population Distribution (Boxplot)
Shows the overall distribution of population data, with outliers such as China and India clearly visible.

### 🔹 Top 10 Most Populous Countries
Horizontal bar chart showing the largest countries by population. This makes it easy to compare the global leaders.

### 🔹 Population Ranking Bar Chart
Displays countries sorted by population percentage, showing how sharply population drops after the top 2.

### 🔹 Least Populated Countries
Focuses on the 10 countries with the smallest populations. This highlights the contrast on the other end of the spectrum.

### 🔹 Population Contribution (Donut Chart)
Shows the percentage contribution of the top 10 countries to the world population. China and India together dominate the chart.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Population is highly concentrated, especially in Asia (China & India).  
- There is a stark contrast between the largest and smallest populations.  
- Visual comparisons make it easier to interpret and communicate insights that are hidden in raw web data.
